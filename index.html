<h2>Thoughts on Accessibility</h2>

<p>If there’s one thing that I’ve learned about accessibility, in general, is that the older I get, the more of a soapbox it becomes. I have a BS in Interior Design, and a significant portion of that coursework revolves around accessibility in building and designing. Then, ten years ago, I got some practical experience with this when my older sister fell down a flight of stairs and broke both of her ankles at the same time; she was in a wheelchair for three months, and she had to live with me because her rent house was completely inaccessible to her. 
</p>

<p>Being able to navigate the web is as important, in many cases, as being able to navigate one’s physical environment. Due to the amount of tasks that are housed online, the end user must be able to easily use any website, regardless of design. Since we obviously can’t expect a person to change his abilities, we must change the way we build and design websites in order to accommodate them.  This means not putting text inside of photos, utilizing special accessibility tools that make buttons keyboard/voice accessible, using readable fonts and subtitles, etc.
</p>

<p>We often consider accessibility to be only for those with disabilities, but in reality, accessibility matters to people using smart watches, keyboards, as well as situational issues (such as not having their glasses or being able to listen to audio) or just having slow internet.  It is imperative that when we’re designing websites or updating websites, that we take all kinds of end users into account, so that the experience is universally accessible. </p>
