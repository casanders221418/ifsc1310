<h2>Thoughts on Accessibility</h2>

<p>If there’s one thing that I’ve learned about accessibility, in general, is that the older I get, the more of a soapbox it becomes. I have a BS in Interior Design, and a significant portion of that coursework revolves around accessibility in building and designing. Then, ten years ago, I got some practical experience with this when my older sister fell down a flight of stairs and broke both of her ankles at the same time; she was in a wheelchair for three months, and she had to live with me because her rent house was completely inaccessible to her. 
</p>

<p>Being able to navigate the web is as important, in many cases, as being able to navigate one’s physical environment. Due to the amount of tasks that are housed online, the end user must be able to easily use any website, regardless of design. Since we obviously can’t expect a person to change his abilities, we must change the way we build and design websites in order to accommodate them.  This means not putting text inside of photos, utilizing special accessibility tools that make buttons keyboard/voice accessible, using readable fonts and subtitles, etc.
</p>

<p>We often consider accessibility to be only for those with disabilities, but in reality, accessibility matters to people using smart watches, keyboards, as well as situational issues (such as not having their glasses or being able to listen to audio) or just having slow internet.  It is imperative that when we’re designing websites or updating websites, that we take all kinds of end users into account, so that the experience is universally accessible. </p>

<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>

<p>Progressive enhancement is an approach to creating websites that focuses on the content first.  Much like the way we have created our projects in class, the HTML is considered first, so that the actual content of the website is available to anyone who seeks after the information that it provides. Then, the CSS and JavaScript are added to allow additional design and functionality/interactivity for those that can access it through their more advanced browser.
</p>

<p>It’s important to take this concept into consideration when creating websites for the masses because accessibility is probably the most important aspect of a website’s design. Without the CSS or JavaScript, the website may be boring, but the information is still available to the masses; however, if the content isn’t accessible to all devices and browsers, then there is a portion of the audience that cannot access whatever it is that you’re providing.
</p>

<p>Here is a similar perspective by Praveen Dubey, where he gives some additional information on PE and how to implement it.

<h2>Project Reflection</h2>

<p>This project, as well as the entire class, has been eye opening for me. I felt like I kind of floated through the html portion at the beginning without too much of a struggle, but it felt logical and allowed me to follow a straightforward process. When we added the CSS, I realized how hard building an entire website can be. The java still feels a bit unattainable, but I have no doubt that I could get it with more instruction and/or a significant amount of practice.</p>
  
<p>One of the things that I loved about this class is that I could join the class from home. I work full-time, and being able to sit in on the class in real time was incredibly helpful while being convenient to my work schedule and allowing me to miss less time than I would if I had to drive in. When I take another synchronous class, I will be more wary of my office setup to maximize my computer monitor space, as well as an additional monitor to see the instruction; 
  I found it particularly helpful to use my iPad to log in to class, leaving my computer free to do the work on.  The days that I was not able to do that, I found it more challenging to keep up with what was going on because I had to switch back and forth between screens or shrink them to a smaller size. </p>
  
<p>The final project, in particular, has exhibited that there are still some major areas that are a struggle for me, and I would like to continue to work on those. Obviously, part of the feedback for me was regarding the visual presentation of the website. I have struggled with adding the photos the way I wanted them to be presented, and I'm honestly not 100% sure how I got the slideshow working. I think I technically met the requirements, but I feel like there are 
  still improvements to be made to make it a really great website. It still feels really basic.</p>
  
<p>I have enjoyed the class a lot. It has been quite a challenge, which is part of the appeal for me. I'm really looking forward to continuing to improve my skills in this.</p>
